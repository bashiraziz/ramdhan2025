      <div className="prose prose-green">
        <p>
          The Ramadan 2025 Food Distribution project is a community-driven initiative aimed at providing essential food
          supplies to families in need during the holy month of Ramadan.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Distribute food packages to 700 households across multiple locations</li>
          <li>Provide a balanced and nutritious selection of food items</li>
          <li>Engage local volunteers and mosques in the distribution process</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          We work closely with local mosques and community leaders to identify families in need. Our team of volunteers
          prepares food packages containing essential items such as rice, cooking oil, sugar, and other staples. These
          packages are then distributed to the identified families in the days leading up to and during Ramadan.
        </p>

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>There are several ways you can support our initiative:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Donate funds to help purchase food items</li>
          <li>Spread awareness about our project in your community</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Together, we can make a significant difference in the lives of those in need during this blessed month.</p>
